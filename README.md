# JS Fun in the Library

## Overview

In front end web development, the programming language you will encounter most
often is JavaScript. Soon, we'll also use HTML and CSS to help a user interact
with our applications, however before we do that, we need to understand how to
use JavaScript to handle the logic of our applications.

In this project, you'll be gaining experience working with variables, primitive
data types, looping, arrays, and objects. As you work through the
iterations, be sure to take time to stop and refactor you solutions. There is
rarely one right way to solve a problem in programming, and part of your job
will be evaulating the trade offs between different approaches to solving a
problem.

## Learning goals

  - Understand what JavaScript primitives are, and how/when to use them
  - Understand how to declare variables and assign data to them
  - Practice using objects and arrays

## Setup

  - Fork this project to your own Github account  
In your terminal...
  - clone the repository to your local machine (`git clone...`)
  - `cd` into the project
  - run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies (it is okay if warnings appear in your terminal)
To test that it's working...
  - run `npm test` and you should see something like:
```bash
book.js
    createTitle
      - should be a function
      - should take in a title and return a modified title
      - should be able to create many modified titles
